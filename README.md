'Country Info App' is an web application where you can check some basic information about each country by selecting it on the map. The application was created using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Project is based on 'React Simple Maps' library, available under link (https://www.react-simple-maps.io/). Using buttons in the header, you can zoom in or out specific parts of the map. When you select a country, external data is downloaded from the API (https://restcountries.eu/), which is then properly displayed on the screen.

In addition, the RWD approach (@media rules) was used to make the application display well on every screen.
